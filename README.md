# Placement-Assessment-Skills-And-Benchmarking
STUDENT SKILLS ASSESSMENT PORTAL – AN OVERVIEW  
          This project is built to enhance the student’s skills assessment and train them for their placements. The system provides an (Aptitude, Logical Reasoning and etc.) practices test that is called a mandatory test to train the all students of various departments during their beginner stage. Based upon the outcome, the system will generate an individual student report, where each and every student data will be analysed and there will be highlighted. Furthermore, test levels will be generated and questions will be randomly distributed for each students. The student can attempt the test multiple times to improve his/ her placement skills. The attempts made by the students and related scores will be updated to the respective faculty members and to the students. It is also needed less manpower to execute the examination. It saves students time in examinations.

EXISTING SYSTEM  
			The Existing Placement Online Assessment Training will not provide the analysis report of the student in an individual basis. Successful training program are well aware of the assessments that are vital part of improving aptitude skills, knowledge and their courage to face the interview. This system has to prepare registration\application form, question paper for the students and required to print a lot of number manually.

PROPOSED SYSTEM  
This web based application system can be implemented in students for placement test.  The student can attempt the test and train multiple times to improve his/ her placement skills.  Each student can be view the test marks and report. Faculty view the student marks on this placement test. Easily understandable and user friendly, quick entries can be made in this system. Avoid the difficulty for each person to come to the exam centre.
